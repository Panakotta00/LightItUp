## Lampmodes
Some lamps have the lampmode functionallity which allowes to use following configs:
- On: Lamp should be always on
- Off: Lamp should be always off
- Auto: Lamp should be on or off depending on daytime
lamps which are fuel powered can be turned off via the "Active"-Switch int the bottom right corner of ther GUI

## Lampgroups
Some lamps support lampgroups. Lampgroups are intended for sharing Lampconfigurations between multiple Lamps. So you can group one street and turn it on, off by one click, without the needance to set each lamp individually. You can create and remove custom groups.
